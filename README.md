# `discord-landing-page`

A minimal, easy-to-use landing page template for Discord servers.

This requires one environment variables, `INVITE`. The `TOKEN` and `GUILD` environment variables are not required, but recommended.  
`TOKEN` is the bot token of a bot in the guild, `GUILD` is the ID of the guild you want to use, and `INVITE` is a Discord invite link.

You can deploy very easily to vercel with the link below, or check out [the demo here](https://discord-landing-page.vercel.app/).
